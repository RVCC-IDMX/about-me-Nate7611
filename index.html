          <p>I'm an 18 year old college student currently enrolled at Raritan Valley Community College. I am in the IDMX program looking to transfer to a 4 year college after RVCC. I started using computers at a very young age and have been hooked ever since. I enjoy a vast range of activities on computers such as playing games, programming, 3D Modeling, animation, and much more. I chose to do the IDMX program as Web Development has always been an interest to me and I think I would enjoy it as a career. I still very much consider myself a beginner and am looking forward to learning much more. This website was done as a project for Web Development 1 and taught the basics of HTML and CSS to me.</p>

        <!-- This article gives the reader a step by step process on how to embed a google map onto their website using iframe -->

        <h1>Embedding Google maps using iFrame</h1>
        
        <hr>

        <div>
          <p><span class="drop-cap">E</span>mbedding a Google Map onto your website is super easy to do. I will explain how you can do it for your own website!</p>

          <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
          <p>You are embedding content from Google onto your website and since this is not your content, it can change at anytime without notice. This also means that if Google Maps goes down, so does the map on your website. While this isn't a issue for most as it is extremely rare for Google Maps to go down and also the chances of Google Maps being shut down anytime soon is near non-existent, it is still something to be aware of. But also, there really aren't any good alternatives.</p>

          <h2>Step 1: Open Google Maps</h2>
          <p>Google Maps serves as the cornerstone for this process. Open your web browser and navigate to <a href="https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>. This is where you'll locate the specific address or location you want to showcase on your website.</p>

          <h2>Step 2: Locate Your Desired Location</h2>
          <p>In the Google Maps interface, use the search bar to enter the address or location you wish to feature on your website. For this example, I will use RVCC. Once you've found your desired location, click on the "Share" button, this should be an icon resembling a chain link. Clicking on "Share" will reveal a set of sharing options, among which is the "Embed a map" feature. Click on this option to access the customization and embedding settings.</p>

          <img src="img/google-maps-share.png">

          <h2>Step 3: Customize Map Size and Copy Embed Code</h2>
          <p>Now that you've selected "Embed a map," Google Maps provides you with the flexibility to customize the size of the map according to your website's layout. You are able to chose between small, medium, large, or even custom. Once you've tailored the map size to your liking, copy the HTML code snippet provided in the "Embed map" section. This code encapsulates the configuration you've chosen, including the size and location details.</p>

          <img src="img/google-maps-copy.png">

          <h2>Step 4: Paste Code into Your Website</h2>
          <p>With the embed code copied to your clipboard, open the HTML file of the webpage where you want the Google Map to appear. This could be the contact page of your business website or an events page for a specific venue. Navigate to the section of your HTML file where you want the map, and paste the copied &lt;iframe&gt; code. The &lt;iframe&gt; tag is a versatile HTML element used for embedding content from other sources, in this case, the Google Map. Adjust the width and height attributes within the &lt;iframe&gt; tag to ensure the map fits well into your website's design.</p>

          <img src="img/google-maps-html.png">

          <h2>Step 4: Making it responsive</h2>
          <p>If we just paste the code into our website, it wont scale down and will cause overflow if viewed on a screen too small. We want to avoid this, and luckily it is very simple. First I put the map in a div with the class google-maps. I centered the div with margin: 0 auto; and then selected the div's iframe with .google-maps iframe. Finally all you have to do to make it scale down properly is to set the max-width to 100%.</p>

          <img src="img/google-maps-css.png">

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Here is how our embedded Google Map will look.</p>
