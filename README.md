## Description

This project was designed to teach me the various basics of web development by continually adding to this project. First we worked on just bare HTML and laying out the website as well as adding links and images which taught me the basic HTML syntax. We then moved onto adding style to the website with CSS where we learned the CSS syntax as well as chose a color scheme and learned how to link CSS files to the HTML. We then refined out HTML skills by adding photos representing out hobbies. We moved forward with responsive design and learning how to change the look of our website when viewed from different devices and why that is important. We then learned about embedding items into our website as well as the potential free-booting issues that come along with that. After that we learned about creating web forms such as making optional/ required fields, adding placeholder text, radio buttons, submit buttons and more. We also learned about how and where this information is sent and how to read it (we are currently doing this through Netlify). Finally we learned about creating a nav bar that will use media states to change how it looks between mobile and desktop platforms. This contains links to jump to various sections on the website. Throughout this whole project we built upon our HTML and CSS skills and learned new features with every new step in the process such as learning flexbox and grid.

## Color Scheme

I really enjoy simplistic almost monochrome websites as I think they look very clean so that's the look I went with on this website. I used various shades of black and white that had a good contrast score and were easy on the eyes.

For the background I used: `#121212`

For the text I used: `#e2e2e2`

For the borders I used a slightly darker color from the text: `#c9c9c9`

For the background of Sections I used a lighter shade of the background: `#242424`
